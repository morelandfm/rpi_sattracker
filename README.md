Hi,

My name is Jon Moreland, an applied physics undergrad in his final semester at the University of Arizona. This code is from a project that I was able to work on over the Summer in association with Marhold Space Systems. The goal for the project was to use a Raspberry Pi to identify and track a model satellite. Then meet a set of criteria for capture after identification (In this case proximity).

Parts:
Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB
Pi Camera Module V2
Arducam IMX219 Wide Angle Camera Module 
Two 9G servos
Arduino Mega 2560 (You don't need this big of a board, just what I had on hand)
One Red LED
One Green LED
One small breadboard
TFMini Plus LiDAR sensor
Lots of wires
Raspberry Pi Case (Mine is 3D printed https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=raspberry%20pi%20case)
Pi Cam pan tilt stand (Mine is 3D printed https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1401116)

To start I needed to set up my Raspberry Pi and PiCam. There are plenty of guides for how to get started with a Raspberry Pi, and this project was more about me getting experience with different programs and operating systems so I just used Raspbian OS and Linux. If you are unfamiliar with getting started on the Raspberry Pi I recommend this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGygESilg8w. It's not required to go with the headless setup, but I recommend it just so you have that option in the future.
